## What is Orders.Exchange?

Orders is the first decentralized exchange (DEX) with orderbooks that fully operates on the Bitcoin network. It harnesses the full potential of Bitcoin's Layer 1 capabilities, powered by a combination of Ordinals protocol, PSBT technology, Bitcoin scripts, and the revolutionary Nostr protocol. Welcome to the future of Bitcoin-based DeFi with comprehensive support for BRC-20 Tokens.

At Orders.Exchange, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what Bitcoin can achieve. Through meticulous development, we have unveiled the incredible possibilities that arise from the synergy between Bitcoin's PSBT technology and the Ordinals protocol. Prepare to witness a trustless ORDERBOOK DEX, Liquidity Pool, SWAP DEX, and LaunchPad, all encapsulated within the ingenious Nostr framework, leveraging its Relay nodes to redefine Bitcoin-based DeFi.

Six months ago, the prevailing belief dictated that Bitcoin was incapable of minting NFTs; three months ago, skeptics denied the existence of Bitcoin Tokens. Prior to the launch of Orders.Exchange, doubts prevailed regarding Bitcoin's ability to support DeFi. However, we hold firm in our conviction that it will soon become evident that Bitcoin has far surpassed its initial expectations, showcasing remarkable capabilities beyond imagination.
